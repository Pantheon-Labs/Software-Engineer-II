# Want an interview?
Applying on Angel.co is a great way to get on our radar, but if you **_really_** want to impress us, we have an opportunity for you...

We want to see your skills in action, including your ability to to use Git + GitHub! Here's what we want you to do:
1. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
1. Make something awesome! This is super open-ended because we want you to get creative. At a minimum, here's what we expect:
    - A `README` with good documentation so we know how to run your code
    - Some sort of üëâ **TypeScript** üëà React and/or Node app that touches on the requirements in the tech listed above (more details on our [job posting](https://angel.co/l/2wyRAn))
    - Utilization of at least one API ([here's a good list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) of free APIs if you need a suggestion!)
    - **Creativity and passion!** We're _tired_ of looking at resumes... tell us something about you and/or why you want to work with us
    - Commit OFTEN... if we see a single commit with everything, we'll be weirded out ü§î
    - Include your resume in the repo (PDFs only please, it's 2022); the nerds on our team don't want it but the rest of our team does.
    - Need help? Check out [our examples](#example-prompts), [Tips](#tips), or [start a discussion to get help](https://github.com/Pantheon-Labs/Careers-SE1/discussions/new?category=get-help)!
1. Make a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to this repo

Once we get your PR, we'll take a look and reach out via the info on your resume and/or comment on the PR!

We're looking forward to seeing what you build üíô

## üò∞ Overwhelmed?
Take a look at [the prompt for our SEI position](https://github.com/Pantheon-Labs/Software-Engineer-I/blob/main/PROMPT.md#pantheon-labs---software-engineer-i) and see if that's a better fit!

# Bonus Points
We don't _officially_ have any bonus points to award, but we'll certainly be pretty dang excited if you do any of the following:
- Add a PostgreSQL database to your app
- Make things pretty üî•
    - React: Use Chakra and style your components/content well (show your gf/bf/mom/dad/dog/cat and see if they're impressed)
    - Node: Follow appropriate REST standards, use query/body data appropriately, use appropriate http status codes
    - `README`: Good markdown is a form of art...
- Add Linting/Test Coverage/CICD/etc. to your app
- Make us laugh while reviewing
- Help us better understand who YOU are
- Follow all the directions! üéâ

# Example Prompts
- **Reddit Client**: Make a React app that pulls Reddit posts from the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- **GitHub Client**: Build a React app that uses the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to retrieve and display interesting information
- **Hire Me Site**: Build a React app that tells us about you, your strengths, your passions, and why you want to join us!
- **Food/Drink Recommendation API**: Create an API that allows users to fetch recommendations for food/drinks based on location, weather, or something else!
- **Nostalgia Machine**: Please help us forget that it's 2022

# Tips
- If you use an API, make sure you don't include your secrets in the repo... add documentation telling us how to generate our own and how to add them to the project
- Don't worry about about comments in your code; good code should be readable
- **Don't stress; just submit SOMETHING and let's have a conversation** üôÇ
